           various values such as CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions per capita, CO2 per kilowatt-hour energy, 
           CO2 per GDP, CO2 produced by coal, CO2 produced by land-use change, and CO2 produced by 
           land-use change per capita. I included this visualization because it allows for easy comparison 
           between different countries since all countries can be viewed at once. This also helps when trying 
           to identify the existence of potential geographic trends. Looking at the interactive map, I discovered a 
           trend between GDP and emissions as a whole. Countries that had higher GDP values tended to have much higher 
           CO2 emission levels in all aspects. For example, countries such as the USA, China, or Russia had 
           significantly higher levels of CO2 growth, coal based emissions, and emissions overall when compared 
           to countries with lower GDP values such as  Niger or Chad. This trend can be explained by the fact that more 
           developed countries have higher GDP values and consequently have the resources to develop massive industries 
           which release CO2 at a rapid rate."),
